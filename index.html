            <P>Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born.</P>
            <p>Luckily EDOBAN is here. EDOBAN is a website application that calculates the exact day of the week you were born. To make it more interesting it generates your <b>Akan name</b> </p>
            <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day-name' which corresponds to the day of the week they were born. </p>
